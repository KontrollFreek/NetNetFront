Currently, I am only one person with a 3DS, WiiU, Nintendo Switch, and a very small budget.

It would help me loads if any volunteers with other Nintendo devices capable of web browsing could send me their results of http://html5test.com/ (click on "Save results" to get a link) on their device via the **issues** tab.
